# ContextMedia
scripts from Cindy's 2014 summer internship

ContextMedia, founded in 2006, is a for-profit healthcare media company providing patient education at the point of care through TVs in physicians’ waiting rooms and tablets in their exam rooms. ContextMedia serves healthcare organizations in all 50 states, has a $15M revenue run rate and has been named in Inc. Magazine’s 5,000 fastest growing companies in the US two years running. 

In the summer of 2014, I interned with ContextMedia's Product Development & Media teams and wrote scripts to develop insights on usage of ContextMedia's tablet platform.
